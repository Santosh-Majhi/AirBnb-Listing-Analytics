## Key Findings and Insights
### Price Trends:

##### 1- Manhattan has the most expensive listings, followed by Brooklyn.
##### 2- Entire homes/apartments cost significantly more than private or shared rooms.
### Room Type Distribution:

##### 1- Entire homes/apartments are the most common, but private rooms offer budget-friendly options.
### Outliers in Price:

##### 1- Few listings priced at $10,000+ were detected, indicating the need to filter such extreme values.
### Availability Patterns:

##### 1- Listings with high availability tend to have lower prices and more reviews, likely due to better guest experience.
### Host Behavior:

##### 1- Some hosts manage multiple listings, indicating a trend toward professional hosting.

## Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into the New York Airbnb market, helping both guests and hosts make informed decisions. By using EDA techniques, we identified key trends and developed actionable recommendations. Future improvements can involve advanced analytics and predictive modeling to further enhance the findings.
